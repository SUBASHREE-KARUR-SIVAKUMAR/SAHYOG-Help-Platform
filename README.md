# SSAHYOG - Together We Empower
SAHYOG is a comprehensive web platform designed to act as a vital bridge, seamlessly connecting individuals in need with compassionate donors and volunteers willing to offer support. Our mission is to foster stronger, more transparent communities by making help accessible and impactful.

The platform facilitates various forms of assistance, from medical and educational aid to food, housing, and general support, with a crucial "Emergency" mode for urgent requests. SAHYOG also features a dedicated initiative focused on Girl Child empowerment, addressing critical areas like education support, protection from violence, and the prevention of child marriage through specific request channels.

A key feature is our interactive map, which allows users to easily locate and identify nearby help centers such as NGOs, food banks, donation centers, and old age homes. This geographical visibility enhances accessibility and streamlines the process of finding and providing aid. Furthermore, a robust review system ensures transparency and builds trust within the community, allowing users to share their experiences and contribute to a verified network of support.

Built with a PHP/MySQL backend and a dynamic HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, SAHYOG provides a user-friendly interface for both those seeking and offering help, embodying its motto: "Together We Empower."
